# Variant Calling Tools

This repository keeps a collect of genomic variant callinng tools. All tools are defined using Common Workflow Language (CWL).
Eevery tool is self-sufficient, can be independently developed, tested, released and used. This clean isolation allows maximum flexibility, maintainability and portability.

These tools are building blocks to create multi-step variant calling workflows as needed, like the workflows here: https://github.com/icgc-argo/variant-calling-wfs
